# Simple eWallet System (Backend, Full Stack Developer Challenge)

This is a simple app that implements wallet feature of an e-commerce application. It basically allows customers to pre-load 
their wallets from their Debit cards. It also allows a customer to transfer virtual money as a gift to another customer within the platform.
Other core functionalities like authentication, authorization, etc. are not considered as they are not the goal of this app.  

## Built with
  * PHP/Laravel
  * Bootstrap
  * MySQL
  * Paystack (Laravel Paystack package)

### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written with Laravel, `PHP Runtime >= 7.2.0` and `Laravel 6` is required to interpret the code. 
If you don't have Laravel runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x).

### Usage (Locally)

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/command prompt window and run:

- Run `composer install` to install necessary packages.
- Create a new database and run `php artisan migrate` to generate the database tables
- Setup your .env file for necessary environmental variables like database details, etc.
- Populate your `customer` and `wallet` table with some dummie data, to test the app. (Email field is important. password can be anything)
- Run `php artisan serve` to start the application.
All done.
